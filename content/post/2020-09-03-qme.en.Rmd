On August 14, 2020 I gave my final presentation where my friends, family, and QME colleagues and friends came to show their support and hear my talk regarding my dissertation topic. In 25 minutes, I presented the most important findings of my 100+ page dissertation. In a 30 slide powerpoint, I argued for a paradigm to be used when measuring SEL constructs with psychometric models. The final oral defense was the safest place to share my work with my dissertation committee! In the end, I passed and officially graduated on August 31, 2020.
